Using transfer learning with MobileNetV2, this project uses a machine learning pipeline to categorize guava leaves into three groups: healthy guava, fruit fly disease, and anthracnose disease. The objective is to develop a reliable and effective model that can identify guava diseases early on, which could improve crop management and lower agricultural losses.

In order to modify the previously trained MobileNetV2 for this multi-class classification problem, the model applies transfer learning and makes use of TensorFlow and Keras.

This project demonstrates a scalable method to detect plant diseases using AI, which can be integrated into:

Mobile Applications: For farmers to scan leaves in real time.
Smart Farming Systems: To automate disease detection and optimize crop yield.
Research Tools: For identifying and studying plant diseases.
